# Ability Extensions

You have around 100 abilities in your bot and you're looking for a way to refactor that mess into more modular classes. `AbillityExtension` is here to support just that! It's not a secret that AbilityBot uses refactoring backstage to be able to construct all of your abilities and map them accordingly. However, AbilityBot searches initially for all methods that return an `AbilityExtension` type. Then, those extensions will be used to search for declared abilities. Here's an example.

```java
public class MrGoodGuy implements AbilityExtension {
    private AbilityBot extensionUser;

    public MrGoodGuy(AbilityBot extensionUser) { this.extensionUser = extensionUser; }

    public Ability nice() {
        return Ability.builder()
                .name("nice")
                .privacy(PUBLIC)
                .locality(ALL)
                .action(ctx -> extensionUser.silent().send("You're awesome!", ctx.chatId())
                );
    }
}

public class MrBadGuy implements AbilityExtension {
    private AbilityBot extensionUser;

    public MrBadGuy(AbilityBot extensionUser) { this.extensionUser = extensionUser; }
    public Ability notnice() {
        return Ability.builder()
                .name("notnice")
                .privacy(PUBLIC)
                .locality(ALL)
                .action(ctx -> extensionUser.silent().send("You're horrible!", ctx.chatId())
                );
    }
}

public class YourAwesomeBot implements AbilityBot {

    // Constructor for your bot

    public AbilityExtension goodGuy() {
        return new MrGoodGuy(this);
    }

    public AbilityExtension badGuy() {
        return new MrBadGuy(this);
    }

    // Override creatorId
}
```

It's also possible to add extensions in the constructor by using the `addExtension()` or `addExtensions()` method:

```java
 public class YourAwesomeBot implements AbilityBot {

    public YourAwesomeBot() {
        super(/* pass required args ... */);
        addExtensions(new MrGoodGuy(this), new MrBadGuy(this));
    }

    // Override creatorId
}
```
